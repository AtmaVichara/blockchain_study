# Go Blockchain Study
This is a basic implementation of a blockchain in Go for the purposes of studying Go, hashing, and blockchain concepts.

## Current Status
The current iteration is not a P2P blockchain. It only supports a GET and POST request to the root route, that either displays the entire chain (GET), or adds a block to the chain (POST). 

## Future Goals
* Restructure Directories
* Implement P2P functionality
* Implement Proof-of-Work
* Implement Merkle Tree for POW
* Incorporate Basic Cryptocurrency
